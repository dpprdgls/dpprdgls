### Hello World 👋 It's [Colin!](https://main--the-best-portfolio.netlify.app/)


I am a Full Stack Developer and budding Cloud Enthusiast. Apart from that I'm a racecar driver, photographer, gamer, and unofficial film critic. I studied at the University of California Santa Barbara where I fell in love with art and photography. These creative fields eventually led to the world of coding. I started learning to code in C++ when I first began in order to make apps for my Arduino before learning Python for Data Science applications. 

The journey didn't stop there as I continued on to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js and MongoDB in order to create full stack applications. After completing UC Berkeley's Full Stack Developer Course I am continuing to learn and hone my skills with the hopes of one day getting the opportunity to do it full time.
